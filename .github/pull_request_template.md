# Pull Request - Audio Quality Preservation Review

## 🔗 Related Issue
Closes #[ISSUE_NUMBER]

## 📝 Implementation Summary
<!-- Describe what you implemented and how -->

### Changes Made:
- [ ] List specific changes
- [ ] Include configuration updates  
- [ ] Note any new dependencies
- [ ] Document testing performed
- [ ] **Audio quality impact assessment**

## 🎵 Audio Quality Preservation Checklist
<!-- REQUIRED for all audio-critical changes -->

### Content-Type Verification:
- [ ] All WAV uploads use `ContentType: "audio/wav"`
- [ ] No `application/octet-stream` for audio files
- [ ] Content-Type is preserved through upload/download cycle

### Compression Prevention:
- [ ] No compression algorithms introduced (gzip, deflate, brotli, etc.)
- [ ] MinIO `PutObjectOptions` preserves original data
- [ ] Presigned URLs don't include transformation parameters
- [ ] Upload paths maintain file integrity

### File Integrity Verification:
- [ ] SHA256 hashing implemented for duplicate detection
- [ ] File integrity verified through upload/download cycle
- [ ] Original file size and properties preserved
- [ ] No data corruption during processing

### Audio-Critical Code Changes:
- [ ] `backend/services/minio*.go` - Quality preservation maintained
- [ ] `backend/handlers/presigned.go` - No compression in upload paths
- [ ] `backend/services/metadata.go` - Audio properties preserved
- [ ] `frontend/upload components` - No client-side file modification

## ✅ Testing Evidence
<!-- Provide evidence that your implementation works -->

### Audio Quality Testing:
```bash
# Paste audio quality verification results
# Example:
# $ go test -v ./... -run AudioQuality
# ✅ TestAudioQualityPreservation PASSED
# ✅ File integrity: Original SHA256 == Downloaded SHA256

# $ mediainfo test_file_before.wav test_file_after.wav
# ✅ Sample Rate: 44100 Hz (preserved)
# ✅ Bit Depth: 16 bits (preserved) 
# ✅ Channels: 2 (preserved)
```

### Local Testing Results:
```bash
# Paste command outputs showing successful implementation
# Example:
# $ curl -X POST /api/upload/presigned -H "Content-Type: application/json"
# ✅ Response includes audio/wav content type

# $ docker logs sermon-uploader-backend
# ✅ No compression warnings in logs
```

### Verification Screenshots:
<!-- Include screenshots if applicable -->
- [ ] Service running successfully
- [ ] Configuration applied correctly
- [ ] Audio upload functionality working
- [ ] **Audio quality preserved in uploaded files**

## ⚠️ Audio-Critical Changes Notice
<!-- Show this section only if audio-critical files are modified -->
This PR modifies audio-critical code paths. The following files require MANDATORY review:

- `backend/services/minio*.go` - MinIO operations must preserve WAV quality
- `backend/handlers/presigned.go` - Upload URLs must not compress audio
- `backend/services/metadata.go` - Audio properties must be preserved
- `frontend/upload components` - Client must not modify file data

**🎵 Audio Quality is CRITICAL** - Any changes that could compromise audio fidelity will be rejected.
