          ## Validation Checks Performed
          
          - [x] Audio/WAV content type preservation
          - [x] No compression in upload paths
          - [x] MinIO quality preservation
          - [x] Frontend file integrity
          - [x] Upload integrity verification
          
          ## Critical Audio Quality Requirements
          
          ‚úÖ **MUST HAVE:** `ContentType: "audio/wav"` for all WAV uploads
          ‚úÖ **MUST NOT:** Include compression algorithms in upload/storage paths
          ‚úÖ **MUST PRESERVE:** Original file integrity through upload/download cycle
          ‚úÖ **MUST VERIFY:** File integrity using checksums/hashing
