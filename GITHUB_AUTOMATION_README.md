## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Suite
**File:** `backend/audio_quality_test.go`

#### Test Categories:
1. **File Integrity Tests**
   - Upload/download cycle preservation
   - SHA256 checksum verification
   - Byte-perfect matching validation

2. **Content-Type Verification**
   - Ensures `audio/wav` preservation
   - Prevents generic binary content-types
   - Validates MinIO metadata integrity

3. **Performance with Quality**
   - Large file upload benchmarks
   - Quality preservation under load
   - No compression for performance trade-offs

4. **Service Layer Testing**
   - MinIO service quality preservation
   - Presigned URL safety verification
   - Duplicate detection integrity

### Integration Testing
- **MinIO Integration:** Real storage operations with quality verification
- **Audio Analysis:** MediaInfo/FFProbe integration for property validation
- **Performance Testing:** Large file handling with integrity checks

## üîç Quality Gates Enforced

### Required Status Checks (ALL MUST PASS):
1. **üéµ Audio Quality Preservation Check** (CRITICAL)
2. **üß™ Backend Tests with Audio Validation**
3. **üîó Integration Tests with MinIO**
4. **üé® Frontend Tests with Upload Validation**
5. **üîí Security Scan**
6. **üèóÔ∏è Build Test**
7. **üö´ Block Dangerous Audio Patterns**

### Audio-Critical Code Protection:
- `backend/services/minio*.go` - MinIO operations
- `backend/handlers/presigned.go` - Upload endpoints
- `backend/services/metadata.go` - Audio property extraction
- `frontend/upload components` - Client-side upload logic

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### Automated Monitoring Schedule:
- **Every 6 hours:** Audio quality health check
- **Every PR:** Quality preservation verification
- **Every deployment:** File integrity validation
- **Weekly:** Comprehensive audio audit

### Alert Conditions:
- Content-type changes from `audio/wav`
- Compression algorithms introduced
- File integrity verification failures
- Upload/download cycle corruption
- Performance regression in audio paths

### Notification Channels:
- GitHub Issues (critical alerts)
- Discord webhooks (real-time notifications)
- Workflow artifacts (detailed reports)

## üö® Critical Requirements Implementation

### 1. Zero-Compression Enforcement
```yaml
# Scans for prohibited compression patterns
COMPRESSION_PATTERNS=("gzip" "deflate" "brotli" "zstd")
for pattern in "${COMPRESSION_PATTERNS[@]}"; do
  if git diff | grep -i "$pattern"; then
    VIOLATIONS+=("Compression detected: $pattern")
  fi
done
```

### 2. Content-Type Verification
```yaml
# Ensures audio/wav preservation
if ! grep "audio/wav" backend/services/; then
  echo "‚ùå Missing audio/wav content type"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. File Integrity Protection
```yaml
# SHA256 verification in tests
ORIGINAL_HASH=$(sha256sum test_file.wav)
DOWNLOADED_HASH=$(sha256sum downloaded_file.wav)
if [ "$ORIGINAL_HASH" != "$DOWNLOADED_HASH" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå File integrity compromised"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 4. MinIO Quality Preservation
```go
// Enforced in all MinIO operations
minio.PutObjectOptions{
    ContentType: "audio/wav",
    // NO compression options - preserves quality
}
```

## üîß Configuration Management

### Branch Protection Rules:
- **Strict status checks:** All quality gates must pass
- **Required reviews:** Code owners must approve audio-critical changes
- **Linear history:** Prevents merge commits that could bypass checks
- **No force pushes:** Maintains complete audit trail

### Repository Settings:
- **Squash merging:** Preferred for clean history
- **Branch deletion:** Automatic cleanup after merge
- **Update branch:** Keeps PRs current with main branch

## üöÄ Deployment Pipeline
