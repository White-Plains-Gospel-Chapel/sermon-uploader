# TDD Test Suite Deliverables for Large File Uploads (500MB+)

## Complete Test Suite Overview

Following strict TDD methodology, I've created a comprehensive test suite that validates the sermon uploader's ability to handle large files (500MB+) for Sunday batch upload scenarios.

## Deliverables

### 1. Core Test Scripts

#### `test-large-files-tdd.sh`
**Standard HTTP Upload Testing**
- ✅ **API Health Check**: Verifies system readiness for large uploads
- ✅ **Single 500MB+ Upload**: Tests `/api/upload` endpoint with large WAV files
- ✅ **Batch Upload (3-5 files)**: Simulates Sunday sermon batch scenarios  
- ✅ **Timeout Handling**: Tests resilience with large file transfers
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Monitors real-time upload progress
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Tests retry mechanisms and mid-stream failures

#### `test-tus-resumable-tdd.sh`
**TUS Resumable Upload Testing**
- ✅ **TUS Configuration Discovery**: Tests `/api/tus` protocol support
- ✅ **Upload Session Creation**: Creates sessions for 500MB+ files
- ✅ **Chunked Upload**: Uploads in 10MB chunks with progress tracking
- ✅ **Resume Capability**: Tests interruption and resume functionality
- ✅ **Performance Analysis**: Optimizes chunk sizes (1MB, 5MB, 10MB)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: TUS-specific error scenarios

#### `run-all-large-file-tests.sh`
**Master Test Runner**
- ✅ **Orchestrates Both Suites**: Runs standard HTTP and TUS tests
- ✅ **Performance Comparison**: Analyzes which method performs better
- ✅ **Production Readiness**: Determines if system is ready for Sunday uploads
- ✅ **Unified Reporting**: Generates comprehensive analysis and recommendations

### 2. Test Configuration

**Target Environment:**
- **Production API**: `https://sermons.wpgc.church`
- **Test Location**: Raspberry Pi at `192.168.1.195`
- **Test Files**: `/home/gaius/data/sermon-test-wavs/...stress-test-files/`
- **File Size**: 500MB+ WAV files only (no small test files)
- **Timeout Settings**: Up to 1 hour for large file transfers
- **Chunk Size**: 10MB for TUS uploads (configurable)
- **Batch Size**: 3-5 files per batch test

### 3. Expected vs Actual Results Analysis

#### Expected Results for Production-Ready System

| Test Case | Expected Result | Success Criteria | Performance Expectation |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| API Health Check | PASS | HTTP 200 OK response | < 5 seconds |
| Single Large Upload | PASS | 500MB+ file uploads completely | 5-15 MB/s transfer speed |
| Batch Upload | PASS | 3-5 files upload without memory issues | Stable memory usage |
| Timeout Handling | PASS | Graceful timeout handling | Retry mechanisms work |
| Progress Tracking | PASS | Upload progress reported accurately | Real-time progress updates |
| Error Recovery | PASS | Retry logic succeeds | < 3 failures before success |
| TUS Configuration | PASS | TUS headers present and valid | Protocol discovery works |
| TUS Chunked Upload | PASS | Files upload in chunks | Progress per chunk |
| TUS Resume | PASS | Uploads resume from interruption | 100% resume success |
| TUS Performance | PASS | Optimal chunk sizes identified | Best performance metrics |

#### Performance Metrics Captured

**Upload Performance:**
- Transfer speed in MB/s per file
- Total duration per file and batch
- System throughput during batch uploads
- Memory efficiency during large transfers

**Reliability Metrics:**
- Success rate percentage
- Retry mechanism effectiveness  
- Resume operation success rate
- Error recovery time

**Optimization Data:**
- Optimal chunk size for TUS uploads
- Maximum effective batch size
- Optimal timeout settings
- Network stability assessment

### 4. Production Recommendations

Based on test results, the system provides specific guidance:

#### Scenario A: Both Methods Working ✅
```
✓ Use TUS resumable uploads for files >1GB or unstable connections
✓ Use standard HTTP uploads for stable connections and smaller large files
✓ Implement automatic fallback: TUS first, then standard HTTP
✓ System ready for Sunday batch sermon uploads
```

#### Scenario B: Standard HTTP Only Working ⚠️
```
⚠ Use standard HTTP uploads for production
⚠ Implement enhanced retry logic for reliability
⚠ Monitor upload progress and adjust timeout settings
⚠ Sunday uploads possible but with increased monitoring
```

#### Scenario C: TUS Resumable Only Working ⚠️
```
⚠ Use TUS resumable uploads exclusively
⚠ Leverage resumable capability for maximum reliability
⚠ TUS is inherently superior for large files
⚠ Sunday uploads recommended via TUS protocol
```

#### Scenario D: Neither Method Working ❌
```
❌ Address server configuration issues before production
❌ Check MinIO backend connectivity and configuration
❌ Review network infrastructure and timeout settings
❌ Sunday uploads not recommended until issues resolved
```

### 5. Generated Reports and Logs

Each test run creates comprehensive documentation:

#### Test Execution Logs
- `sermon_upload_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Standard HTTP test details
- `sermon_tus_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - TUS resumable test details  
- `sermon_master_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Combined test execution

#### JSON Results Files
- `sermon_upload_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Standard HTTP results
- `sermon_tus_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - TUS resumable results
- `sermon_master_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Unified analysis

#### Performance Analysis
- Upload speeds for each test file
- Comparison between upload methods
- Optimal configuration recommendations
- Production readiness assessment

### 6. Sunday Batch Upload Simulation

The test suite specifically simulates real Sunday scenarios:

**Typical Sunday Upload Scenario:**
- 3-5 large sermon recordings (500MB-1GB each)
- Simultaneous or sequential uploads
- Network conditions may vary
- Time pressure (quick turnaround needed)
- Reliability is critical (no re-recording possible)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Batch upload of multiple large files
- ✅ Progress tracking for user feedback
- ✅ Error recovery if uploads fail
- ✅ Resume capability for interrupted uploads
- ✅ Performance optimization for fastest uploads
- ✅ Memory efficiency during large transfers

### 7. Integration with Existing System

The test suite integrates with the current architecture:

**API Endpoints Tested:**
- `GET /api/health` - System health validation
- `POST /api/upload` - Standard HTTP multipart upload
- `OPTIONS /api/tus` - TUS protocol configuration discovery
- `POST /api/tus` - TUS upload session creation
- `PATCH /api/tus/:id` - TUS chunk upload
- `HEAD /api/tus/:id` - TUS upload status query

**MinIO Integration:**
- Direct uploads to production MinIO instance
- File verification and integrity checking
- Duplicate detection validation
- Bucket organization verification

**Discord Notifications:**
- Tested with actual Discord webhook integration
- Batch notification functionality
- Error reporting through Discord
- Progress updates during large uploads

### 8. Maintenance and Monitoring

**Pre-Production Testing:**
```bash
# Quick health check before Sunday
curl -s https://sermons.wpgc.church/api/health | jq .
```

**Weekly Monitoring:**
```bash
# Weekly abbreviated test
./test-large-files-tdd.sh | grep -E "(PASS|FAIL|MB/s)"
```

**Monthly Full Assessment:**
```bash
# Comprehensive monthly testing
./run-all-large-file-tests.sh > monthly_test_$(date +%Y%m%d).log 2>&1
```
