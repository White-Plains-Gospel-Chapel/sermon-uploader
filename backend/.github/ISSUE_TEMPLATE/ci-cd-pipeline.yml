        ## Objective
        Create a robust yet practical CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality while being manageable for daily development workflows.
        
        **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 days
        **Risk Level**: High (affects entire development workflow)
        **Dependencies**: All testing infrastructure must be in place

      value: |
        **Stage 1: Code Quality** (Fast Feedback)
        - Linting and formatting checks
        - Security scanning (gosec)
        - Dependency vulnerability scanning
        - ~2-3 minutes execution time
        
        **Stage 2: Testing** (Comprehensive Validation)
        - Unit tests with coverage reporting
        - Integration tests (if environment available)
        - Performance benchmarks
        - ~5-8 minutes execution time
        
        **Stage 3: Build Verification** (Multi-Platform)
        - Build for Linux amd64 (production target)
        - Build for macOS arm64 (development)
        - Build for Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi)
        - Docker image creation and testing
        - ~3-5 minutes execution time
        
        **Stage 4: Deployment** (Conditional)
        - Deploy to staging (automatic on main branch)
        - Production deployment (manual approval or tag-based)
        - Post-deployment verification
        - ~2-5 minutes execution time

      label: Quality Gates and Thresholds
      value: |

        - [ ] Security scan shows no high-severity issues
        - [ ] All unit tests pass
        - [ ] Coverage meets threshold (as selected above)
        - [ ] All target platforms build successfully
        
        **Warning Checks** (reported but don't block):
        - [ ] Integration tests (may be environment-dependent)
        - [ ] Performance benchmarks (regression detection)
        - [ ] Dependency freshness checks
        
        **Deployment Gates**:
        - [ ] All required checks pass
        - [ ] Manual approval for production (if selected)
        - [ ] No conflicting deployments in progress

      label: Risk Mitigation & Rollback Plan
      value: |
        **High-Risk Scenarios & Mitigations**:
        
        1. **Pipeline Becomes Too Strict**
           - Risk: Developers can't merge PRs due to overly strict requirements
           - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, bypass procedures for hotfixes
           
        2. **CI Pipeline Performance Issues**
           - Risk: Tests take too long, slow down development
           - Mitigation: Parallel execution, incremental testing, caching
           
        3. **Flaky Tests Block Development**
           - Risk: Unreliable tests prevent valid code from merging
           - Mitigation: Test stability monitoring, quarantine system
           
        4. **External Service Dependencies**
           - Risk: Docker Hub, GitHub Actions, or other services down
           - Mitigation: Fallback strategies, local alternatives
           
        **Rollback Procedures**:
        - Disable specific failing checks via GitHub settings
        - Emergency bypass procedures documented
        - Hotfix branch strategy for critical production issues
        - Automated rollback triggers for failed deployments
