        - `make build-all` - Build for all supported platforms
        - `make docker-build` - Build Docker image
        - `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
        
        **Environment Management**:

    attributes:
      label: Git Hooks Strategy
      value: |
        **Pre-commit Hooks** (fast, essential checks):
        - Code formatting (gofmt, goimports)
        - Basic linting (critical errors only)
        - Syntax validation
        - ~10-20 seconds execution time
        
        **Pre-push Hooks** (comprehensive validation):
        - Full test suite execution
        - Security scanning
        - Build verification
        - Coverage validation
        - ~2-5 minutes execution time
        
        **Hook Management**:
        - Easy installation with `make setup-hooks`
        - Bypass procedures for emergency commits
        - Clear error messages with fix instructions
        - Cross-platform compatibility
        
  - type: textarea
    id: developer-experience
    attributes:
      label: Developer Experience Features
      value: |
        **Hot Reload Development**:
        - Automatic restart on code changes
        - Fast startup time (< 5 seconds)
        - Clear startup and error logging
        - Browser refresh integration (if applicable)
        
        **Debugging Support**:
        - Integrated pprof profiler endpoints
        - Debug logging configuration
        - Development vs production environment detection
        - Race detection in development mode
        
        **Environment Setup**:
        - One-command development environment setup
        - Automatic tool installation and verification
        - Environment validation and troubleshooting
        - Documentation for manual setup fallbacks
        
  - type: textarea
    id: cross-platform-support
    attributes:
      label: Cross-Platform Compatibility
      value: |
        **Target Platforms**:
        - macOS (primary development)
        - Linux (CI/CD and production)
        - Docker (containerized development)
        - Windows (optional, basic support)
        
        **Platform-Specific Considerations**:
        - Path handling differences
        - Shell compatibility (bash vs zsh vs fish)
        - Tool installation methods
        - Performance characteristics
        
        **Fallback Strategies**:
        - Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
        - Clear error messages for missing dependencies
        - Manual alternative procedures documented
        
  - type: textarea
    id: dependencies
    attributes:
      label: Dependencies & Integration Points
      value: |
        **Requires**:
        - feat/go-linting-setup (integrates linting tools)
        
        **Integrates With**:
        - feat/go-unit-tests (test execution targets)
        - feat/go-integration-tests (comprehensive test targets)
        - feat/ci-cd-pipeline (same commands used in CI)
        
        **External Tool Dependencies**:
        - Air for hot reload (go install)
        - Docker for containerized development
        - Make (system package manager)
        - Git (assumed available)
        
  - type: textarea
    id: acceptance-criteria
    attributes:
      label: Acceptance Criteria
      value: |
        **Functionality**:
        - [ ] `make dev` provides smooth development experience
        - [ ] All Makefile targets work across macOS and Linux
        - [ ] Git hooks install and function correctly
        - [ ] Hot reload restarts application on code changes
        - [ ] Debugging and profiling tools accessible

        - [ ] Clear error messages when tools missing or misconfigured
        - [ ] Documentation covers common development workflows
        - [ ] Performance is reasonable (not excessively slow)
        
        **Integration**:
        - [ ] Works with existing project structure
        - [ ] Compatible with CI/CD pipeline commands
        - [ ] Integrates with linting and testing infrastructure

        **Key Files to Create/Modify**:
        - `Makefile` - Comprehensive development targets
        - `.air.toml` - Hot reload configuration
        - `.githooks/pre-commit` - Pre-commit validation script
        - `.githooks/pre-push` - Pre-push validation script
        - `scripts/setup-dev-env.sh` - Development environment setup
        - `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer onboarding guide
        
        **Best Practices**:
        - Fail fast with clear error messages
        - Provide both automated and manual alternatives
        - Use consistent command patterns across targets
        - Include help text for all major targets
        - Version pin external tools when possible
        
        **Avoid Over-Engineering**:
        - Don't create tools that duplicate existing functionality
        - Keep Makefile readable and maintainable
        - Avoid complex shell scripting in Makefiles
        - Focus on common developer workflows
