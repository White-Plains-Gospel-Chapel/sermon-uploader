        ## Objective
        Clean up and consolidate the multiple overlapping documentation files created during testing implementation into a coherent, maintainable documentation structure.
        
        **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
        **Risk Level**: Very Low (documentation only)
        **Dependencies**: None (can run in parallel with other work)

      value: |
        **Problems Identified**:
        - [ ] Multiple overlapping TDD guides (TDD-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md, TDD-DEVELOPER-ONBOARDING.md, TDD-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
        - [ ] Redundant information across different files
        - [ ] Inconsistent formatting and structure
        - [ ] Some documentation is overly verbose for practical use
        - [ ] Missing integration between different documentation pieces
        - [ ] Unclear navigation and discovery of relevant docs
        
        **Impact**:
        - New developers confused about which docs to read
        - Information scattered across multiple files
        - Maintenance burden of keeping multiple docs in sync
        - Reduced adoption due to documentation overload

        **Target Structure** (after consolidation):
        
        ```
        docs/
        ├── DEVELOPMENT.md          # Single comprehensive development guide
        ├── TESTING.md              # Consolidated testing practices guide  
        ├── API.md                  # API documentation (if applicable)
        └── DEPLOYMENT.md           # Deployment and operations guide
        
        ROOT/
        ├── README.md               # Updated with clear navigation

        └── CHANGELOG.md            # Release notes and changes
        ```
        
        **Consolidation Rules**:
        - Keep the most practical and actionable content
        - Remove redundant sections across files
        - Create clear cross-references between related topics
        - Maintain a single source of truth for each topic
        - Focus on common use cases rather than exhaustive coverage
