        ## Objective
        Create integration testing infrastructure that tests real interactions with MinIO, Discord webhooks, and other external services in controlled environments.
        
        **Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days
        **Risk Level**: High (involves external services and Docker)
        **Dependencies**: feat/go-unit-tests

      label: Scope of Work
      value: |
        - [ ] Create Docker composition for test environment (MinIO, test containers)
        - [ ] Implement MinIO integration tests (bucket operations, file upload/download)
        - [ ] Implement Discord webhook integration tests (message sending, error handling)
        - [ ] Create test data setup and teardown procedures
        - [ ] Add integration test runner scripts (`make test-integration`)
        - [ ] Configure test environment isolation
        - [ ] Add timeout and retry logic for unreliable network operations
        - [ ] Document integration test setup and troubleshooting

        **Docker Test Stack**:
        - MinIO container (latest stable)
        - Test data initialization container
        - Network isolation for test environment
        
        **Test Data Management**:
        - Pre-created test buckets and objects
        - Automated cleanup after test runs
        - Test file fixtures (various sizes and formats)
        
        **Service Configuration**:
        - Test-specific MinIO credentials
        - Mock/test Discord webhook endpoints
        - Isolated test environment variables

      label: Risk Mitigation Strategies
      value: |
        **High-Risk Areas & Mitigations**:
        
        1. **Docker Dependency**
           - Risk: Tests fail if Docker not available
           - Mitigation: Clear error messages, optional test skipping
           
        2. **Network Reliability**
           - Risk: Flaky tests due to network issues
           - Mitigation: Retry logic, reasonable timeouts, local containers
           
        3. **Test Data Pollution**
           - Risk: Tests interfere with each other
           - Mitigation: Isolated test buckets, thorough cleanup
           
        4. **Service Unavailability**
           - Risk: External service down breaks all tests
           - Mitigation: Use local test containers, graceful degradation
           
        5. **CI/CD Integration**
           - Risk: Integration tests slow down or break CI pipeline
           - Mitigation: Parallel execution, optional CI runs, fast feedback

    id: dependencies
    attributes:
      label: Dependencies & Prerequisites
      value: |
        **Requires**:
        - feat/go-unit-tests merged (establishes test patterns)
        - Docker available on development machines
        - docker-compose for orchestrating test services
        
        **Blocks**:
        - feat/ci-cd-pipeline (CI needs integration tests to run)
        
        **External Requirements**:
        - MinIO Docker image access
        - Ability to create isolated Docker networks
        - Sufficient disk space for test containers
