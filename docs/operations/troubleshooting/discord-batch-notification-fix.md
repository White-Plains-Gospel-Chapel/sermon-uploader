# Discord Batch Notification Fix

**Issue**: Batch uploads weren't triggering Discord notifications properly
**Resolution Date**: September 5, 2025
**Severity**: Medium - Functional issue affecting user notification experience

## üîç Problem Description

### Symptoms
- Batch uploads (2+ files) were not sending Discord notifications to the `#sermons-uploading-notif` channel
- Individual file uploads were working correctly
- No error messages were visible to users
- System was functioning otherwise normally

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was an **architectural gap** between the frontend's batch upload workflow and the backend's Discord notification system:

1. **Frontend Flow**: Used presigned URLs for batch uploads ‚Üí called individual `/api/upload/complete` for each file
2. **Backend Logic**: Discord batch notifications only triggered from `/api/upload` endpoint (direct uploads)
3. **Missing Link**: No batch completion endpoint for presigned URL uploads

## üõ† Technical Investigation

### Investigation Steps

1. **Recent Upload Analysis**
   - Found evidence of batch upload attempts with 1.8GB files
   - MinIO showed successful uploads but no Discord notifications
   - Logs showed individual file completions, not batch processing

2. **Code Architecture Review**
   - **Frontend**: `useUploadQueue.ts` lines 147-149 called `completeUpload()` individually
   - **Backend**: Only `/api/upload` endpoint triggered `SendUploadStart(len(files), isBatch)`
   - **Gap**: Presigned URL flow never triggered batch Discord functions

3. **Discord Webhook Verification**
   - Webhook URL was correct and functional
   - Test endpoint (`/api/test/discord`) worked perfectly
   - Issue was purely in the notification triggering logic

### Key Files Affected

```
backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers/presigned.go         # Added ProcessUploadedFilesBatch()
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go                       # Added /api/upload/complete-batch route  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/discord.go           # Existing batch functions (working)

frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/api.ts                    # Added completeUploadBatch()
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/uploadService.ts     # Exported new function
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/useUploadQueue.ts       # Modified batch processing logic
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implementation

### TDD Approach

1. **Failing Tests First**: Created comprehensive test suite to verify:
   - Batch uploads trigger `SendUploadStart(count, true)`
   - Single uploads trigger `SendUploadStart(count, false)` 
   - Proper batch threshold detection (default: 2 files)
   - Error handling for Discord webhook failures

2. **Implementation**: Built functionality to make tests pass
3. **Refactoring**: Optimized for maintainability and error handling

### Backend Changes

#### New Endpoint: `/api/upload/complete-batch`
```go
func (h *Handlers) ProcessUploadedFilesBatch(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
    fileCount := len(req.Filenames)
    isBatch := fileCount >= h.config.BatchThreshold
    
    // Send Discord batch notifications
    h.discordService.SendUploadStart(fileCount, isBatch)
    // ... process files ...
    h.discordService.SendUploadComplete(successful, duplicates, failed, isBatch)
}
```

#### Route Registration
```go
api.Post("/upload/complete-batch", h.ProcessUploadedFilesBatch)
```

### Frontend Changes

#### New API Function
```typescript
async completeUploadBatch(filenames: string[]) {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/upload/complete-batch`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ filenames })
    })
    return response.json()
}
```

#### Upload Queue Logic
```typescript
// Track successful uploads for batch completion
const successfulUploads: string[] = []

// After all files upload successfully
if (successfulUploads.length > 0) {
    await uploadService.completeUploadBatch(successfulUploads)
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Batch Threshold
- **Environment Variable**: `BATCH_THRESHOLD=2`
- **Default**: 2 files minimum for batch notifications
- **Configurable**: Can be adjusted per deployment needs

### Discord Webhook
- **Environment Variable**: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- **Channel**: `#sermons-uploading-notif`
- **Test Endpoint**: `/api/test/discord`

## üìä Verification Testing

### Automated Tests
- ‚úÖ Batch completion endpoint functionality
- ‚úÖ Batch threshold detection (1 file = individual, 2+ files = batch)
- ‚úÖ Discord notification triggering
- ‚úÖ Error handling and fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing individual upload flow

### Manual Testing Script
Created `test_batch_notifications.sh` for comprehensive validation:
```bash
# Test Discord webhook connectivity
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/test/discord"

# Test batch completion with multiple files
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/upload/complete-batch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filenames": ["test1.wav", "test2.wav", "test3.wav"]}'
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Batch Uploads (2+ files)
1. User drags multiple WAV files to web interface
2. Frontend gets presigned URLs for batch upload
3. Files upload directly to MinIO with progress tracking
4. **NEW**: Frontend calls `/api/upload/complete-batch` with all filenames
5. **NEW**: Backend sends Discord notification: "üì§ **Batch Upload Started** - Processing 3 file(s)"
6. Backend processes metadata for each file
7. **NEW**: Backend sends Discord notification: "‚úÖ Success - **Batch Upload Complete** - ‚úÖ 3 uploaded"

### Individual Uploads (1 file)
1. Same flow as before - no changes
2. Calls `/api/upload/complete` (individual)
3. Sends individual Discord notification with metadata

### Error Handling
- **Discord webhook down**: System continues, logs warning
- **Batch endpoint unavailable**: Falls back to individual completions
- **Partial upload failures**: Reports accurate counts in Discord

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

1. **Frontend**: Revert `useUploadQueue.ts` to call individual `completeUpload()`
2. **Backend**: Remove batch completion route (optional - won't break anything)
3. **Zero downtime**: Changes are additive and backward compatible

## üìà Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Reduced API calls**: 1 batch completion vs N individual completions
- **Better user experience**: Accurate batch progress notifications
- **Cleaner Discord channel**: Single batch notification vs N individual ones

### Minimal Overhead
- **Memory**: Negligible array storage for batch filenames
- **CPU**: Batch processing is more efficient than individual calls
- **Network**: Fewer HTTP requests overall

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Production Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Backend builds successfully: `go build main.go`
- [ ] Frontend TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Discord webhook URL configured correctly
- [ ] `BATCH_THRESHOLD` environment variable set (default: 2)

### Deployment Steps
1. **Backend**: Deploy new Go binary with batch endpoint
2. **Frontend**: Deploy updated React build with batch logic
3. **Verification**: Run `test_batch_notifications.sh` script
4. **Monitoring**: Watch Discord channel for notifications

### Post-deployment Verification
- Upload single file ‚Üí Verify individual notification
- Upload 2+ files ‚Üí Verify batch notification  
- Check Discord webhook test: `/api/test/discord`
